# Proposed changes to the second algorithm described in this [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841520301213) 

## First Approach 

Using the median value of the minimum hamming distances vector doesnâ€™t seem to be justified, it could be affected by outliers in the minimum hamming distances, as well as the median. A softer technique could be better for this case. For instance, a histogram-like aggregation of the hamming distances, followed by a low-pass filter of the occurrences, followed by the selection of the lower local maximums of the histogram can be a good start; and does not add a lot of processing time.

## Second Approach 
On the other hand, (out of the question scope) matching the high-level vectors of features prior to the BoB creation could be an option, although, a pre-processing step could be needed, a filtering stage could work well
